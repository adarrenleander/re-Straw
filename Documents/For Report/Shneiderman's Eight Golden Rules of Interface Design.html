  </p>
  <p><span class="regular_text">These rules were obtained from the text <i>Designing 
    the User Interface</i> by Ben Shneiderman. Shneiderman proposed this collection 
    of principles that are derived heuristically from experience and applicable 
    in most interactive systems after being properly refined, extended, and interpreted

  <span class="regular_text">To improve the usability of an application it is important to have a well 
    designed interface. Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design" 
    are a guide to good interaction design. </span>
  <p>
    <b><span class="regular_text">1 Strive for consistency.</span></b><br>
    <span class="regular_text">Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; 
    identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; 
    and consistent commands should be employed throughout.</span>
  
</p></div>
<p><b><span class="regular_text">2 Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.</span></b><br>
<span class="regular_text">
  As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number 
  of interactions and to increase the pace of interaction. Abbreviations, function 
  keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to an expert user. 
</span>
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">3 Offer informative feedback.</span></b><br>
 <span class="regular_text"> For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent 
  and minor actions, the response can be modest, while for infrequent and major 
  actions, the response should be more substantial. </span>
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">4 Design dialog to yield closure.</span></b><br>
 <span class="regular_text"> Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, 
  and end. The informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives 
  the operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, the signal 
  to drop contingency plans and options from their minds, and an indication that 
  the way is clear to prepare for the next group of actions. </span>
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">5 Offer simple error handling.</span></b><br>
 <span class="regular_text"> As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error. 
  If an error is made, the system should be able to detect the error and offer 
  simple, comprehensible mechanisms for handling the error. </span> 
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">6 Permit easy reversal of actions.</span></b><br>
 <span class="regular_text"> This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; 
  it thus encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility 
  may be a single action, a data entry, or a complete group of actions. </span>
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">7 Support internal locus of control.</span></b><br>
  <span class="regular_text">Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the 
  system and that the system responds to their actions. Design the system to make 
  users the initiators of actions rather than the responders. </span>
</p><p><b><span class="regular_text">8 Reduce short-term memory load.</span></b><br>
 <span class="regular_text"> The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires 
  that displays be kept simple, multiple page displays be consolidated, window-motion 
  frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for codes, mnemonics, 
  and sequences of actions.</span> <br>
